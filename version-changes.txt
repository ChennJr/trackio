Version 0.0.3

- Adjusted chunking to be with available memory rather than list size. This allows me to better control the use of computational resources without noticeably impacting the performance of the device. 

- Created a create_empty_csv() function which creates an empty csv with the required columns if the file does not exist. This eliminates the extra row problem from the previous version after setting header=False when writing to the file. The problem was that the header of the dataset was being appended in each chunk, ultimately creating an extra row.
