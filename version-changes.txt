Version 0.0.4

- Used the spotipy api to get audio features and artist features of each track in the dataset. 

- create_spotify_client() creates a spotify client with my program's Spotify client_id and client_secret which was retrieved from Spotify's developer dashboard. 

- The Spotify client_secret and client_id is stored in an env file such that they are not visible within the code and hidden from the user.

- spotify_call() attempts a specific Spotify API call and returns its results

- process_batch() specifically attempts to get audio features and artist features using api calls through spotify_call() that allows for batching. This speeds up the rate at which i collect all the audio features. 

- get_audio_features() calls process_batch() for each batch of tracks. 

- audio features are joined with their respective unique track_uri

- all audio features collected are stored as audio_features.csv

Errors/Problems
- All the audio features took me over 20 days to collect due to Spotify API limits. I could only attempt around 100,000 API calls each day where there are over 2,000,000 tracks within my dataset.
