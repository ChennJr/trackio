Version 0.0.7

- Used QT Design Studio to create a mockup of a GUI design. 
- Transferred the design to QT Creator. Used a stack view with two components, that switch based off a button signal. 
- Created the UI design for the login page and the recommendation page. 
- Created a slot in view.py to connect the python backend to the qml file. 
- Created a function to retrieve the user input from the qml file. 
- QML file is loaded within view.py while presenter.py connects both the model and view.
